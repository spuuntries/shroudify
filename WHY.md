# üóØÔ∏è Why:

There are a few reasons,

1. **I haven't seen many steganography projects published on npm**  
   There has only been [**a few notable**](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=Steganography&ranking=popularity) steganography implementations that's on npm's registry, with even less being text-based; _in fact_, there's only one that _I_ can mention off the top of my head right now, which is [**StegCloak**](https://github.com/KuroLabs/stegcloak).

   While I can assure you that this project is nowhere near perfect, being maintained by a dumdum like me, I hope that the project can contribute something to npm as a whole, however small that is.

2. **This module is very extendable**  
   Written in js, there are many ways this project could be implemented.
   I've provided two example projects, one already integrated into the thing, which is the CLI, and a BD/PC plugin.

3. **This is my first ever npm project**  
   I've worked extensively with the npm registry for just about every project I've ever worked on, and it has been most reliable thing I've worked with thus far ~~(not talking abt controversies here)~~, so I want to contribute back to the registry with this thing.
